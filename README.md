## Example of 3D rendering with Metal and Swift

![](demovideo.gif)

### Basically you will find in this Swift project:

* 3D Model loading, texturizing and rendering.
* Shaders: vertex, fragment and kernel. In the kernel I implemented  ```Loki``` for Random generation of colors. You can check the repo [here](https://github.com/YoussefV/Loki)


### Here you can find all the material I used:

* [Raywenderlich Getting Started in Metal](https://www.raywenderlich.com/7475-metal-tutorial-getting-started)

* [Raywenderlich Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEqbZ7Ai7AA&list=PL23Revp-82LJG3vcDPm8w7b5HTKjBOY0W&index=1)

#### You will find that Raywenderlich material is not free, there is a part of it on this playlist, but is also outdated (Older version of Swift). You will have to work it out :).
